abstract = {Learning sophisticated feature interactions behind user behaviors is critical in maximizing CTR for recommender systems. Despite great progress, existing methods seem to have a strong bias towards low- or high-order interactions, or require expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we show that it is possible to derive an end-to-end learning model that emphasizes both low- and highorder feature interactions. The proposed model, DeepFM, combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature learning in a new neural network architecture. Compared to the latest Wide and Deep model from Google, DeepFM has a shared input to its "wide" and "deep" parts, with no need of feature engineering besides raw features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DeepFM over the existing models for CTR prediction, on both benchmark data and commercial data.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning framework, namely HIN2Vec, for heterogeneous information networks (HINs). The core of the proposed framework is a neural network model, also called HIN2Vec, designed to capture the rich semantics embedded in HINs by exploiting different types of relationships among nodes. Given a set of relationships specified in forms of meta-paths in an HIN, HIN2Vec carries out multiple prediction training tasks jointly based on a target set of relationships to learn latent vectors of nodes and meta-paths in the HIN. In addition to model design, several issues unique to HIN2Vec, including regularization of meta-path vectors, node type selection in negative sampling, and cycles in random walks, are examined. To validate our ideas, we learn latent vectors of nodes using four large-scale real HIN datasets, including Blogcatalog, Yelp, DBLP and U.S. Patents, and use them as features for multi-label node classification and link prediction applications on those networks. Empirical results show that HIN2Vec soundly outperforms the state-of-the-art representation learning models for network data, including DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, PTE, HINE and ESim, by 6.6{\%} to 23.8{\%} of {\$}micro{\$}-{\$}f{\_}1{\$} in multi-label node classification and 5{\%} to 70.8{\%} of {\$}MAP{\$} in link prediction.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve an improved performance with additional robustness to its so-called and well-recognized mode collapse. We first proceed by mapping the desired data onto a frame-based space for a sparse representation to lift any limitation of small support features prior to learning the structure. To that end, we start by dividing an image into multiple patches and modifying the role of the generative network from producing an entire image, at once, to creating a sparse representation vector for each image patch. We synthesize an entire image by multiplying generated sparse representations to a pre-trained dictionary and assembling the resulting patches. This approach restricts the output of the generator to a particular structure, obtained by imposing a Union of Subspaces (UoS) model to the original training data, leading to more realistic images, while maintaining a desired diversity. To further regularize GANs in generating high-quality images and to avoid the notorious mode-collapse problem, we introduce a third player in GANs, called reconstructor. This player utilizes an auto-encoding scheme to ensure that first, the input-output relation in the generator is injective and second each real image corresponds to some input noise. We present a number of experiments, where the proposed algorithm shows a remarkably higher inception score compared to the equivalent conventional GANs.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) has become one of the most popular and widely used methods in recommender systems, but its performance degrades sharply for users with rare interaction data. Most existing hybrid CF methods try to incorporate side information such as review texts to alleviate the data sparsity problem. However, the process of exploiting and integrating side information is computationally expensive. Existing hybrid recommendation methods treat each user equally and ignore that the pure CF methods have already achieved both effective and efficient recommendation performance for active users with sufficient interaction records and the little improvement brought by side information to these active users is ignorable. Therefore, they are not cost-effective solutions. One cost-effective idea to bypass this dilemma is to generate sufficient “real” interaction data for the inactive users with the help of side information, and then a pure CF method could be performed on this augmented dataset effectively. However, there are three major challenges to implement this idea. Firstly, how to ensure the correctness of the generated interaction data. Secondly, how to combine the data augmentation process and recommendation process into a unified model and train the model end-to-end. Thirdly, how to make the solution generalizable for various side information and recommendation tasks. In light of these challenges, we propose a generic and effective CF model called AugCF that supports a wide variety of recommendation tasks. AugCF is based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets that additionally consider the class (like or dislike) as a feature to generate new interaction data, which can be a sufficiently real augmentation to the original dataset. Also, AugCF adopts a novel discriminator loss and Gumbel-Softmax approximation to enable end-to-end training. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale recommendation datasets, and the experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model.},

To select high-quality candidate videos for real-time top-N recommendation generation, we utilize additional factors like video type and time factor to compute similar videos.

To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model, we conduct comprehensive experiments by collecting real data from Tencent Video.

abstract = {The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, known as the AUC, is currently considered to be the standard method to assess the accuracy of predictive distribution models. It avoids the supposed subjectivity in the threshold selection process, when continuous probability derived scores are converted to a binary presence-absence variable, by summarizing overall model performance over all possible thresholds. In this manuscript we review some of the features of this measure and bring into question its reliability as a comparative measure of accuracy between model results. We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Among them, heterogeneous information networks (HIN)-based recommender systems provide a unified approach to fuse various auxiliary information, which can be combined with mainstream recommendation algorithms to effectively enhance the performance and interpretability of models, and thus have been applied in many kinds of recommendation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic survey of HIN-based recommender systems, including four aspects: concepts, methods, applications, and resources. Specifically, we firstly introduce the concepts related to recommender systems, heterogeneous information networks and HIN-based recommendation. Secondly, we present more than 70 methods categorized according to models or application scenarios, and describe representative methods symbolically.

In addition, our model learns effective relation representations between users and items to capture rich information in HIN by optimizing a multi-label classification problem.

DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10{\%} higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60{\%} less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable.

We apply this insight to design a state-of-the-art RNN recommender system. We first describe our RNN-based recommender system in use at YouTube. Next, we offer "Latent Cross," an easy-to-use technique to incorporate contextual data in the RNN by embedding the context feature first and then performing an element-wise product of the context embedding with model's hidden states.

abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation — collaborative filtering — on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering — the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user–item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

abstract = {Recently, deep learning has become a preferred choice for performing tasks in diverse application domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, sensor data analytics for healthcare, and collaborative filtering for personalized item recommendation. In addition, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has become one of the most popular frameworks for training machine learning models. Motivated by the huge success of GAN and deep learning on a wide range of fields, this paper explores an effective way to exploit both techniques into the collaborative filtering task for the accurate recommendation. We have noticed that the IRGAN and GraphGAN are pioneering methods that successfully apply GAN to recommender systems. However, we point out an issue regarding the employment of standard matrix factorization (MF) as their basic model, which is linear and unable to capture the non-linear, subtle latent factors underlying user-item interactions. Our proposed recommendation framework, named Collaborative Adversarial Autoencoders (CAAE), significantly extends the conventional IRGAN and GraphGAN as summarized below: 1) we use Autoencoder, which is one of the most successful deep neural networks, as our generator, instead of using the MF model; 2) we employ Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) as our discriminative model; and 3) we incorporate another generator model into our framework that focuses on generating negative items, which are items that a given user may not be interested in. We empirically test our framework using three real-life datasets along with four evaluation metrics. Owing to those extensions, our proposed framework not only produces considerably higher recommendation accuracy than the conventional GAN-based recommenders (i.e., IRGAN and GraphGAN), but also outperforms the other state-of-the-art top-N recommenders (i.e., BPR, PureSVD, and FISM).},

abstract = {Heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been widely adopted in recommender systems due to its excellence in modeling complex context information. Although existing HIN based recommendation methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they have two major shortcomings. First, these models seldom learn an explicit representation for path or meta-path in the recommendation task. Second, they do not consider the mutual effect between the meta-path and the involved user-item pair in an interaction. To address these issues, we develop a novel deep neural network with the co-attention mechanism for leveraging rich meta-path based context for top-N recommendation. We elaborately design a three-way neural interaction model by explicitly incorporating meta-path based context. To construct the meta-path based context, we propose to use a priority based sampling technique to select high-quality path instances. Our model is able to learn effective representations for users, items and meta-path based context for implementing a powerful interaction function. The co-attention mechanism improves the representations for meta-path based context, users and items in a mutual enhancement way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. In particular, the proposed model performs well in the cold-start scenario and has potentially good interpretability for the recommendation results.},

abstract = {Many predictive tasks of web applications need to model categorical variables, such as user IDs and demographics like genders and occupations. To apply standard machine learning techniques, these categorical predictors are always converted to a set of binary features via one-hot encoding, making the resultant feature vector highly sparse. To learn from such sparse data effectively, it is crucial to account for the interactions between features.Factorization Machines (FMs) are a popular solution for efficiently using the second-order feature interactions. However, FM models feature interactions in a linear way, which can be insufficient for capturing the non-linear and complex inherent structure of real-world data. While deep neural networks have recently been applied to learn non-linear feature interactions in industry, such as the Wide{\&}Deep by Google and DeepCross by Microsoft, the deep structure meanwhile makes them difficult to train.In this paper, we propose a novel model Neural Factorization Machine (NFM) for prediction under sparse settings. NFM seamlessly combines the linearity of FM in modelling second-order feature interactions and the non-linearity of neural network in modelling higher-order feature interactions. Conceptually, NFM is more expressive than FM since FM can be seen as a special case of NFM without hidden layers. Empirical results on two regression tasks show that with one hidden layer only, NFM significantly outperforms FM with a 7.3{\%} relative improvement. Compared to the recent deep learning methods Wide{\&}Deep and DeepCross, our NFM uses a shallower structure but offers better performance, being much easier to train and tune in practice.},

abstract = {Real-life recommender systems often face the daunting task of providing recommendations based only on the clicks of a user session. Methods that rely on user profiles - such as matrix factorization - perform very poorly in this setting, thus item-to-item recommendations are used most of the time. However the items typically have rich feature representations such as pictures and text descriptions that can be used to model the sessions. Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel RNN (p-RNN) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items. We also propose alternative training strategies for p-RNNs that suit them better than standard training. We show that p-RNN architectures with proper training have significant performance improvements over feature-less session models while all session-based models outperform the item-to-item type baseline.},

However, most studies have focused on a single typed external relationship and not fully utilized the latent relationships among users and items. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous network embedding-based recommendation method called HetNERec. Specifically, we first construct the co-occurrence networks by extracting multiple co-occurrence relationships from a recommendation-oriented heterogeneous network. We then propose an integration function to integrate multiple network embedded representations into a single representation to enhance the recommendation performance. Finally, the matrix factorization is extended by integrating the embedded representations and considering the latent relationships among users and items. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed HetNERec outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation --- collaborative filtering --- on the basis of implicit feedback.Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering --- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items.By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

Similarity join is studied in homogeneous network but not studied in heterogeneous networks. The heterogeneity of the HINs are ignored completely by the previous research on similarity join which takes different semantic meanings.

abstract = {Venue recommendation approaches have become particularly useful nowadays due to the increasing number of users registered in location-based social networks (LBSNs), applications where it is possible to share the venues someone has visited and establish connections with other users in the system. Besides, the venue recommendation problem has certain characteristics that differ from traditional recommendation, and it can also benefit from other contextual aspects to not only recommend independent venues, but complete routes or venue sequences of related locations. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the problem of route recommendation under the perspective of generating a sequence of meaningful locations for the users, by analyzing both their personal interests and the intrinsic relationships between the venues. We divide this problem into three stages, proposing general solutions to each case: First, we state a general methodology to derive user routes from LBSNs datasets that can be applied in as many scenarios as possible; second, we define a reranking framework that generate sequences of items from recommendation lists using different techniques; and third, we propose an evaluation metric that captures both accuracy and sequentiality at the same time. We report our experiments on several LBSNs datasets and by means of different recommendation quality metrics and algorithms. As a result, we have found that classical recommender systems are comparable to specifically tailored algorithms for this task, although exploiting the temporal dimension, in general, helps on improving the performance of these techniques; additionally, the proposed reranking strategies show promising results in terms of finding a trade-off between relevance, sequentiality, and distance, essential dimensions in both venue and route recommendation tasks.},

Significant research has focused on how time, location, interfaces, and a plethora of other contextual features affect recommendations. However, in using deep neural networks for recommender systems, researchers often ignore these contexts or incorporate them as ordinary features in the model. In this paper, we study how to effectively treat contextual data in neural recommender systems. We begin with an empirical analysis of the conventional approach to context as features in feed-forward recommenders and demonstrate that this approach is inefficient in capturing common feature crosses. We apply this insight to design a state-of-the-art RNN recommender system. We first describe our RNN-based recommender system in use at YouTube. Next, we offer "Latent Cross," an easy-to-use technique to incorporate contextual data in the RNN by embedding the context feature first and then performing an element-wise product of the context embedding with model's hidden states. We demonstrate the improvement in performance by using this Latent Cross technique in multiple experimental settings.},

Recent advances in the study of Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) have shed some light on how to leverage heterogeneous information in RS. However, existing HIN-based recommendation models assume HIN is invariable and merely use HIN as a data source for assisting recommendation, which limits their performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning framework, called MTRec, for recommendation over HIN. MTRec relies on self-attention mechanism to learn the semantics of meta-paths in HIN and jointly optimizes the tasks of both recommendation and link prediction. Using a Bayesian task weight learner, MTRec is able to achieve the balance of two tasks during optimization automatically. Moreover, MTRec provides good interpretabilities of recommendation through a 'translation' mechanism which is used to model the three-way interactions among users, items and the meta-paths connecting them. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MTRec over state-of-the-art HIN-based recommendation models, and the case studies we provide illustrate that MTRec enhances the explainability of RS.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous information network (HIN) attracts increasing attention from the communities of recommender systems. HIN based recommendation methods can help overcome the difficulties of data sparsity and cold start. The majority of the existing HIN based recommendation methods use path-based semantic similarity between users and/or between items on HINs. However, the existing HIN based recommendation methods using metapath disregard the semantic differences among multiple metapaths (i.e., inter-metapaths) and the influence differences among neighbor pairs in each individual metapath (i.e., intra-metapaths). To solve these problems, we propose an attention-aware metapath-based network embedding for HIN based recommendation. To obtain additional semantic information, our method generates multiple metapath-based weighted homogeneous networks to model the auxiliary information of users and items of HIN. Thereafter, we design a novel self-attention integration to integrate multiple semantic information from multiple weighted homogenous information networks. Lastly, we utilize three deep neural network methods to model the implicit relations between users and items for the rating prediction task. Experimental results of three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art recommendation methods, solves the data sparsity problem, and models the multiple semantic information of users and items.},

Existing methods mainly rely on hand-engineered features from KGs (e.g., meta paths), which requires domain knowledge. This paper presents RKGE, a KG embedding approach that automatically learns semantic representations of both entities and paths between entities for characterizing user preferences towards items. Specifically, RKGE employs a novel recurrent network architecture that contains a batch of recurrent networks to model the semantics of paths linking a same entity pair, which are seamlessly fused into recommendation. It further employs a pooling operator to discriminate the saliency of different paths in characterizing user preferences towards items. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows the superiority of RKGE against state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that RKGE provides meaningful explanations for recommendation results.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) have been playing an increasingly important role for informed consumption, services, and decision-making in the overloaded information era and digitized economy. In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs that usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth elaboration of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviours (e.g., users' clicks on items), and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research. Finally, we discuss new research opportunities in this exciting and vibrant area.},

They immediately achieved state-of-the-art in image synthesis, image-to-image translation, text-to-image generation, image inpainting and have been used in sciences ranging from medicine to high-energy particle physics. Despite their popularity and ability to learn arbitrary distributions, GAN have not been widely applied in recommender systems (RS). Moreover, only few of the techniques that have introduced GAN in RS have employed them directly as a collaborative filtering (CF) model. In this work we propose a new GAN-based approach that learns user and item latent factors in a matrix factorization setting for the generic top-N recommendation problem. Following the vector-wise GAN training approach for RS introduced by CFGAN, we identify 2 unique issues when utilizing GAN for CF. We propose solutions for both of them by using an autoencoder as discriminator and incorporating an additional loss function for the generator. We evaluate our model, GANMF, through well-known datasets in the RS community and show improvements over traditional CF approaches and GAN-based models. Through an ablation study on the components of GANMF we aim to understand the effects of our architectural choices. Finally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of the matrix factorization performance of GANMF.},

abstract = {Protein–protein interaction plays an important role in the understanding of biological processes in the body. A network of dynamic protein complexes within a cell that regulates most biological processes is known as a protein–protein interaction network (PPIN). Complex prediction from PPINs is a challenging task. Most of the previous computation approaches mine cliques, stars, linear and hybrid structures as complexes from PPINs by considering topological features and fewer of them focus on important biological information contained within protein amino acid sequence. In this study, we have computed a wide variety of topological features and integrate them with biological features computed from protein amino acid sequence such as bag of words, physicochemical and spectral domain features. We propose a new Sequential Forward Feature Selection (SFFS) algorithm, i.e., random forest-based Boruta feature selection for selecting the best features from computed large feature set. Decision tree, linear discriminant analysis and gradient boosting classifiers are used as learners. We have conducted experiments by considering two reference protein complex datasets of yeast, i.e., CYC2008 and MIPS. Human and mouse complex information is taken from CORUM 3.0 dataset. Protein interaction information is extracted from the database of interacting proteins (DIP). Our proposed SFFS, i.e., random forest-based Brouta feature selection in combination with decision trees, linear discriminant analysis and Gradient Boosting Classifiers outperforms other state of art algorithms by achieving precision, recall and F-measure rates, i.e. 94.58{\%}, 94.92{\%} and 94.45{\%} for MIPS, 96.31{\%}, 93.55{\%} and 96.02{\%} for CYC2008, 98.84{\%}, 98.00{\%}, 98.87 {\%} for CORUM humans and 96.60{\%}, 96.70{\%}, 96.32{\%} for CORUM mouse dataset complexes, respectively.},

The core of the proposed framework is a neural network model, also called HIN2Vec, designed to capture the rich semantics embedded in HINs by exploiting different types of relationships among nodes. Given a set of relationships specified in forms of meta-paths in an HIN, HIN2Vec carries out multiple prediction training tasks jointly based on a target set of relationships to learn latent vectors of nodes and meta-paths in the HIN. In addition to model design, several issues unique to HIN2Vec, including regularization of meta-path vectors, node type selection in negative sampling, and cycles in random walks, are examined. To validate our ideas, we learn latent vectors of nodes using four large-scale real HIN datasets, including Blogcatalog, Yelp, DBLP and U.S. Patents, and use them as features for multi-label node classification and link prediction applications on those networks. Empirical results show that HIN2Vec soundly outperforms the state-of-the-art representation learning models for network data, including DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, PTE, HINE and ESim, by 6.6{\%} to 23.8{\%} ofmicro-f1 in multi-label node classification and 5{\%} to 70.8{\%} of MAP in link prediction.},

The existing recommendation explanation approaches only consider the single explanation style, such as aspect-level or review-level.

In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i.e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations.

abstract = {The explicitly observed social relations from online social platforms have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to mitigate the data sparsity issue. However, the direct usage of explicit social relations may lead to an inferior performance due to the unreliability (e.g., noises) of observed links. To this end, the discovery of reliable relations among users plays a central role in advancing social recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to adaptively identify implicit friends toward discovering more credible user relations. Particularly, implicit friends are those who share similar tastes but could be distant from each other on the network topology of social relations. Methodologically, to find the implicit friends for each user, we first model the whole system as a heterogeneous information network, and then capture the similarity of users through the meta-path based embedding representation learning. Finally, based on the intuition that social relations have varying degrees of impact on different users, our approach adaptively incorporates different numbers of similar users as implicit friends for each user to alleviate the adverse impact of unreliable social relations for a more effective recommendation. Experimental analysis on three real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method and explain why implicit friends are helpful in improving social recommendation.},

abstract = {This paper provides a unified account of two schools of thinking in information retrieval modelling: The generative retrieval focusing on predicting relevant documents given a query, and the discriminative retrieval focusing on predicting relevancy given a querydocument pair. We propose a game theoretical minimax game to iteratively optimise both models. On one hand, the discriminative model, aiming to mine signals from labelled and unlabelled data, provides guidance to train the generative model towards fithing the underlying relevance distribution over documents given the query. On the other hand, the generative model, acting as an aftacker to the current discriminative model, generates difficult examples for the discriminative model in an adversarial way by minimising its discrimination objective. With the competition between these two models, we show that the unified framework takes advantage of both schools of thinking: (i) the generative model learns to fit the relevance distribution over documents via the signals from the discriminative model, and (ii) the discriminative model is able to exploit the unlabelled data selected by the generative model to achieve a beffer estimation for document ranking.

abstract = {Most objects and data in the real world are of multiple types, interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However, most network science researchers are focused on homogeneous networks, without distinguishing different types of objects and links in the networks. We view interconnected, multityped data, including the typical relational database data, as heterogeneous information networks, study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of structural types of objects and links in the networks, and develop a structural analysis approach on mining semi-structured, multi-typed heterogeneous information networks. In this article, we summarize a set of methodologies that can effectively and efficiently mine useful knowledge from such information networks, and point out some promising research directions.},

abstract = {Cold-start recommendation has been a challenging problem due to sparse user-item interactions for new users or items. Existing efforts have alleviated the cold-start issue to some extent, most of which approach the problem at the data level. Earlier methods often incorporate auxiliary data as user or item features, while more recent methods leverage heterogeneous information networks (HIN) to capture richer semantics via higher-order graph structures. On the other hand, recent meta-learning paradigm sheds light on addressing cold-start recommendation at the model level, given its ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks with scarce labeled data, or in the context of cold-start recommendation, new users and items with very few interactions. Thus, we are inspired to develop a novel meta-learning approach named MetaHIN to address cold-start recommendation on HINs, to exploit the power of meta-learning at the model level and HINs at the data level simultaneously. The solution is non-trivial, for how to capture HIN-based semantics in the meta-learning setting, and how to learn the general knowledge that can be easily adapted to multifaceted semantics, remain open questions. In MetaHIN, we propose a novel semantic-enhanced tasks constructor and a co-adaptation meta-learner to address the two questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaHIN significantly outperforms the state of the arts in various cold-start scenarios.

abstract = {With the emergence of online social networks (OSNs), video recommendation has come to play a crucial role in mitigating the semantic gap between users and videos. Conventional approaches to video recommendation primarily focus on exploiting content features or simple user-video interactions to model the users' preferences. Although these methods have achieved promising results, they fail to model the complex video context interdependency, which is obscure/hidden in heterogeneous auxiliary data from OSNs. In this paper, we study the problem of video recommendation in Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) due to its excellence in characterizing heterogeneous and complex context information. We propose a Context-Dependent Propagating Recommendation network (CDPRec) to obtain accurate video embedding and capture global context cues among videos in HINs. The CDPRec can iteratively propagate the contexts of a video along links in a graph-structured HIN and explore multiple types of dependencies among the surrounding video nodes. Then, each video is represented as the composition of the multimodal content feature and global dependency structure information using an attention network. The learned video embedding with sequential based recommendation are jointly optimized for the final rating prediction. Experimental results on real-world YouTube video recommendation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared with strong baselines.},

abstract = {With the prevalence of mobile e-commerce nowadays, a new type of recommendation services, called intent recommendation, is widely used in many mobile e-commerce Apps, such as Taobao and Amazon. Different from traditional query recommendation and item recommendation, intent recommendation is to automatically recommend user intent according to user historical behaviors without any input when users open the App. Intent recommendation becomes very popular in the past two years, because of revealing user latent intents and avoiding tedious input in mobile phones. Existing methods used in industry usually need laboring feature engineering. Moreover, they only utilize attribute and statistic information of users and queries, and fail to take full advantage of rich interaction information in intent recommendation, which may result in limited performances. In this paper, we propose to model the complex objects and rich interactions in intent recommendation as a Heterogeneous Information Network. Furthermore, we present a novel Metapath-guided Embedding method for Intent Recommendation (called MEIRec). In order to fully utilize rich structural information, we design a metapath-guided heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to learn the embeddings of objects in intent recommendation. In addition, in order to alleviate huge learning parameters in embeddings, we propose a uniform term embedding mechanism, in which embeddings of objects are made up with the same term embedding space. Offline experiments on real large-scale data show the superior performance of the proposed MEIRec, compared to representative methods. Moreover, the results of online experiments on Taobao e-commerce platform show that MEIRec not only gains a performance improvement of 1.54{\%} on CTR metric, but also attracts up to 2.66{\%} of new users to search queries.},
